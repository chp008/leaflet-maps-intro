#Building maps with Leaflet.js
This is the code behind my NICAR 2016 session on making maps with [Leaflet.js](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet).

####1. Why Leaflet.js?
- Free, open source and has a huge community behind it
- Minimal amount of code

- [Plugins](http://leafletjs.com/plugins.html)!
	Example of the [markercluster plugin](http://csessig86.github.io/tabletop_to_leaflet/#cluster)
