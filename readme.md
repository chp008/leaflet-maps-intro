#Building maps with Leaflet.js
This is the code behind my NICAR 2016 session on making maps with [Leaflet.js](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet). This session is best for people with a beginner's understanding of Javascript.

####1. Why Leaflet.js?
- Free, open source and actively maintained
- Well documented with great examples
- Has a huge community behind it
- Used by a lot of people
- Minimal amount of code
- Mobile friendly
- Can handle thousands of data points without loading too slowly
- [Plugins](http://leafletjs.com/plugins.html)! Example of the [markercluster plugin](http://csessig86.github.io/tabletop_to_leaflet/#cluster)

####2. The set up
This repo has two directories:

- 01-base is the base directory you will need to get started. None of the mapping code has been written in this directory.
- 02-markers and 02-geojson are the two final projects we are going to build.
